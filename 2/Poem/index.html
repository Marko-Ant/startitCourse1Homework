		<h2>A Shy Little Poem</h2>
		<p class ="left">
			This is a poem, but it's a little shy, you know<br/>
			I guess you already figured out how to make it show 
		</p>
		<p class ="right">
			But I wouldn't even presume to call it a real poem<br/> 
			In fact, we are barely past the first verse, and it doesn't even rhyme anymore
		</p>
		<p class ="left">
			Although poems <strong>are</strong> just words, and we think they are better words than other words<br/>
			Yes, this one is definitely just a lot of words. 
		</p>

			I lied, it's not just words, that last one was a picture<br/> 
			at least it should be, if my html/css skills didn't fail me
		</p>
		<p class ="right">
			<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p class ="left">
			And if you were wondering - that last one was blank on purpose<br/>
			Because nothing is perfect, and definitely not this little poem
		</p>
		<p class ="right">
			And I guess it has to end somewhere<br/>
			After all, I'm out of ideas, and out of knowledge...
		</p>
		<p class ="left"> 
			...and out of time to google everything I don't know,<br/> 
			So I bid you farewell, and thank you for staying, until the end, with this little poem.
