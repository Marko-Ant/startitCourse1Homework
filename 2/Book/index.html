				<strong>Malvolio.</strong> Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Viola.</strong> Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since<br> 
				arrived but hither.<br> 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Malvolio.</strong> She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have<br>
				saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.<br> 
				She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord<br> 
				into a desperate assurance she will none of him:<br> 
				and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to<br> 
				come again in his affairs, unless it be to report<br> 
				your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Viola.</strong> She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Malvolio.</strong> Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her<br> 
				will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth<br> 
				stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be<br> 
				it his that finds it.

				<strong>Viola.</strong> I left no ring with her: what means this lady?<br> 
				Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!<br> 
				She made good view of me; indeed, so much,<br> 
				That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,<br> 
				For she did speak in starts distractedly.<br> 
				She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion<br> 
				Invites me in this churlish messenger.<br> 
				None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.<br> 
				I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,<br> 
				Poor lady, she were better love a dream.<br> 
				Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,<br> 
				Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.<br> 
				How easy is it for the proper-false<br> 
				In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!<br> 
				Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!<br> 
				For such as we are made of, such we be.<br> 
				How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;<br> 
				And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;<br> 
				And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.<br> 
				What will become of this? As I am man,<br> 
				My state is desperate for my master's love;<br> 
				As I am woman,—now alas the day!—<br> 
				What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!<br> 
				O time! thou must untangle this, not I;<br> 
				It is too hard a knot for me to untie!<br>
